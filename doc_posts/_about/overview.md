SAMMI is a proprietary application developed using GameMaker Studio 2 and has gained recognition as one of the most versatile and customizable Stream Assistant available. The foundation of SAMMI is built upon LioranBoard 2, a project originally developed by Lioran Waters.

In June 2022, the SAMMI Founder team embarked on expanding the original LioranBoard 2 codebase. This effort focused on adding new features and fixing long-standing bugs, responding to the needs of the LioranBoard 2 community.

By August 2022, this evolution led to a significant milestone: the project was rebranded and officially became known as SAMMI.
